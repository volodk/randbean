nicebean
========

Summary: Populates java beans with random dummy data and makes your life a bit easier ...

When: If you need to fill a pojo object with dummy data and you really want to avoid tons of keystrokes like these

obj.setPropertyA(...)
obj.setPropertyB(...)
obj.setPropertyC(...)
obj.setPropertyD(...)
obj.setPropertyE(...)
...
obj.setPropertyZ(...)

Call for action: You can try this tool. Usage is very simple. Just annotate an instance field(s) in your jUnit test and you're ready to go.

Thanks,  

P.S. Nicebean is a kind of "working" project name
